<sj>I</sj> <v>am</v> <cp>going</cp> to school.

<sj>I</sj> <v>was</v> <cp>going</cp> to school.

<sj>I</sj> <v>have</v> <pp>been</pp> to Tokyo.

<sj>I</sj> <v>had</v> <pp>been</pp> to Tokyo.

<v>Is</v> <sj>Jim</sj> still <cp>talking</cp> to Jane?

My <sj>husband</sj> <v>is</v> always <cp>complaining</cp> about everything.

<sj>I</sj> <v>am</v> <cp>leaving</cp> in a few minutes.

<sj>I</sj> <v>am</v> just <cp>being</cp> honest with you.

<sj>Victor</sj> <v>is</v> <cp>being</cp> very mean for some reason.

<sj>I</sj> <v>was</v> <cp>reading</cp> a book at that time.

<sj>I</sj> <v>have</v> <not>not</not> <pp>seen</pp> Jack in a long time.

<sj>I</sj> <v>have</v> <not>never</not> <pp>said</pp> such a terrible thing to my parents.

<v>Have</v> <sj>you</sj> ever <pp>seen</pp> a <ssj>film</ssj> <pp>called</pp> "Last Gamble"?

<sj>I</sj> <v>had</v> <pp>lived</pp> in Osaka for 5 years by that time.

<sj>Jason</sj> <v>is</v> <not>not</not> a rude person in any sense.

On the contrary, <sj>he</sj> <v>is</v> usually nice and friendly.

<sj>I</sj> <v>have</v> <pp>known</pp> him since kindergarten.

My <sj>parents</sj> <v>know</v> him well, too.

<sj>They</sj> <v>like</v> him.

However, <sj>he</sj> <v>has</v> <pp>been</pp> <cp>acting</cp> quite old lately.

<sj>He</sj> <v>ignore</v> me very often.

Actually, almost always.

<sj>What</sj> <v>is</v> <cp>going</cp> on with him?

Maybe <sj>he</sj> <v>is</v> <cp>having</cp> some sort of problem with me.

Maybe <sj>I</sj> <v>did</v> something wrong to him.

Why <not>doesn't</not> <sj>he</sj> <v>tell</v> me then?
