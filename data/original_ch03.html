<s>I</s> <v>go</v> to bed before midnight every night.

<s>Ken</s> <v>came</v> from Okinawa.

The <s>weather</s> <av>will</av> <v>be</v> fine.

<s>She</s> <v>was</v> very happy with her family.

The <s>scenery</s> <v>was</v> truly spectacular.

The <s>artist</s> <v>looked</v> really old.

<s>I</s> <v>met</v> many foreigners at the restaurant.

<s>I</s> <v>came</v> back from the nearby convenience store.

<s>People</s> <v>ate</v> dog's meat hundreads of years ago.

<s>You</s> suddenly <v>made</v> me sad.

<s>It</s> <av>will</av> <v>be</v> fine on the weekend.

<s>Things</s> <av>will</av> <v>turn</v> for you soon.

The <s>situation</s> <av>will</av> <v>become</v> even worse.

<s>One</s> of my best friends <v>was</v> extremely diligent.

<s>He</s> <v>studied</v> over 10 hours every day.

<s>He</s> hardly <v>slept</v>.

Fore some reason, <s>he</s> <v>was</v> very nice to me.

<s>He</s> <v>helped</v> me with my homework all the time.

His <s>intelligence</s> <v>was</v> well beyound my own.

One day, <s>he</s> suddenly <v>transferred</v> to some other school.

<s>What</s> <v>happend</v> to him?

<s>I</s> <not>don't</not> <v>know</v>.

<s>I</s> just <not>don't</not> <v>see</v> him anymore.

<av>Will</av> <s>I</s> ever <v>see</v> him again?

<s>I</s> <not>don't</not> <v>know</v>.
