<sj>I</sj> <v>go</v> to bed before midnight every night.

<sj>Ken</sj> <v>came</v> from Okinawa.

The <sj>weather</sj> <av>will</av> <v>be</v> fine.

<sj>She</sj> <v>was</v> very happy with her family.

The <sj>scenery</sj> <v>was</v> truly spectacular.

The <sj>artist</sj> <v>looked</v> really old.

<sj>I</sj> <v>met</v> many foreigners at the restaurant.

<sj>I</sj> <v>came</v> back from the nearby convenience store.

<sj>People</sj> <v>ate</v> dog's meat hundreads of years ago.

<sj>You</sj> suddenly <v>made</v> me sad.

<sj>It</sj> <av>will</av> <v>be</v> fine on the weekend.

<sj>Things</sj> <av>will</av> <v>turn</v> for you soon.

The <sj>situation</sj> <av>will</av> <v>become</v> even worse.

<sj>One</sj> of my best friends <v>was</v> extremely diligent.

<sj>He</sj> <v>studied</v> over 10 hours every day.

<sj>He</sj> hardly <v>slept</v>.

<sj>Everybody</sj> <v>called</v> him crazy.

Fore some reason, <sj>he</sj> <v>was</v> very nice to me.

<sj>He</sj> <v>helped</v> me with my homework all the time.

His <sj>intelligence</sj> <v>was</v> well beyound my own.

One day, <sj>he</sj> suddenly <v>transferred</v> to some other school.

<sj>What</sj> <v>happend</v> to him?

<sj>I</sj> <not>don't</not> <v>know</v>.

<sj>I</sj> just <not>don't</not> <v>see</v> him anymore.

<av>Will</av> <sj>I</sj> ever <v>see</v> him again?

<sj>I</sj> <not>don't</not> <v>know</v>.
