<sj>James</sj> <v>is</v> a teacher.

<sj>Linda</sj> <v>plays</v> soccer.

<sj>Greg</sj> usually <v>gets</v> up at six.

<sj>I</sj> <v>am</v> Japanese.

<sj>They</sj> <v>are</v> foreigners.

<sj>That</sj> <v>is</v> magnificent.

<sj>You</sj> <v>go</v> first.

<sj>We</sj> often <v>play</v> tennis.

That <sj>painting</sj> <v>looks</v> great.

<sj>They</sj> <v>eat</v> cat's meat in their village.

<sj>Allison</sj> <v>is</v> at home.

<sj>I</sj> <v>give</v> you money.

<sj>You</sj> <v>make</v> me happy.

My <sj>father</sj> <v>is</v> a habitual drinker.

The negative <sj>image</sj> of alcohol <v>is</v> widespread.

However, <sj>alcohol</sj> <v>has</v> a great variety of benefits.

<sj>I</sj> <v>drink</v> one glass of wine at dinner every evening.

<sj>It</sj> <v>helps</v> me tremendously in many ways.

For example, a good <sj>wine</sj> <v>is</v> a good appetizer.

<sj>I</sj> always <v>enjoy</v> the meal with it.

Another positive <sj>aspect</sj> of alcohol <v>is</v> its <cp>tranquilizing</cp> effect.

Thanks to the dinner wine, <sj>I</sj> <v>have</v> a good sleep every night.
<av>Do</av> <sj>you</sj> <v>go</v>?

<sj>You</sj> <v>are</v> <not>not</not> nice.

<v>Go</v>.

<sj>You</sj> <av>may</av> <v>be</v> nice.

<sj>I</sj> <v>am</v> <pp>pleased</pp> with the test result.

<sj>I</sj> <v>am</v> <not>not</not> tall.

Boys, <v>be</v> ambitious.

<v>Is</v> <sj>he</sj> really happy with his job?

<av>Do</av> <sj>you</sj> <v>like</v> your school?

<sj>I</sj> usually <not>don't</not> <v>drink</v> cold water.

<sj>I</sj> <not>don't</not> always <v>eat</v> rice at meals.

<sj>Monica</sj> <not>won't</not> <v>leave</v> for some reason.

<sj>I</sj> <not>can't</not> entirely <v>agree</v>.

<sj>I</sj> <v>am</v> <pp>surprised</pp> at his progress.

<sj>John</sj> <v>is</v> very much <pp>delighted</pp> with my idea.

Japan's political <sj>stance</sj> <v>is</v> often <pp>criticized</pp> as "indecisive".

<sj>That</sj> <av>may</av> <v>be</v> true.

<sj>Things</sj> <v>look</v> quite unclear in Japanese politics.

However, <sj>I</sj> <v>disagree</v>.

Political <sj>leaders</sj> <v>deal</v> with delicate issues day and night.

Therefore, in many cases, <sj>they</sj> just <not>can't</not> <v>be</v> very clear.

In other words, <sj>they</sj> <av>must</av> <v>make</v> unclear statements due to the nature of the job.

In my opinion, <sj>we</sj> <v>are</v> a little too critical about politics and politicians.

What <av>do</av> <sj>you</sj> <v>think</v>?

<av>Do</av> <sj>you</sj> <v>agree</v> with me?
<sj>I</sj> <v>go</v> to bed before midnight every night.

<sj>Ken</sj> <v>came</v> from Okinawa.

The <sj>weather</sj> <av>will</av> <v>be</v> fine.

<sj>She</sj> <v>was</v> very happy with her family.

The <sj>scenery</sj> <v>was</v> truly spectacular.

The <sj>artist</sj> <v>looked</v> really old.

<sj>I</sj> <v>met</v> many foreigners at the restaurant.

<sj>I</sj> <v>came</v> back from the nearby convenience store.

<sj>People</sj> <v>ate</v> dog's meat hundreads of years ago.

<sj>You</sj> suddenly <v>made</v> me sad.

<sj>It</sj> <av>will</av> <v>be</v> fine on the weekend.

<sj>Things</sj> <av>will</av> <v>turn</v> for you soon.

The <sj>situation</sj> <av>will</av> <v>become</v> even worse.

<sj>One</sj> of my best friends <v>was</v> extremely diligent.

<sj>He</sj> <v>studied</v> over 10 hours every day.

<sj>He</sj> hardly <v>slept</v>.

<sj>Everybody</sj> <v>called</v> him crazy.

Fore some reason, <sj>he</sj> <v>was</v> very nice to me.

<sj>He</sj> <v>helped</v> me with my homework all the time.

His <sj>intelligence</sj> <v>was</v> well beyound my own.

One day, <sj>he</sj> suddenly <v>transferred</v> to some other school.

<sj>What</sj> <v>happend</v> to him?

<sj>I</sj> <not>don't</not> <v>know</v>.

<sj>I</sj> just <not>don't</not> <v>see</v> him anymore.

<av>Will</av> <sj>I</sj> ever <v>see</v> him again?

<sj>I</sj> <not>don't</not> <v>know</v>.
<sj>I</sj> <v>am</v> <cp>going</cp> to school.

<sj>I</sj> <v>was</v> <cp>going</cp> to school.

<sj>I</sj> <v>have</v> <pp>been</pp> to Tokyo.

<sj>I</sj> <v>had</v> <pp>been</pp> to Tokyo.

<v>Is</v> <sj>Jim</sj> still <cp>talking</cp> to Jane?

My <sj>husband</sj> <v>is</v> always <cp>complaining</cp> about everything.

<sj>I</sj> <v>am</v> <cp>leaving</cp> in a few minutes.

<sj>I</sj> <v>am</v> just <cp>being</cp> honest with you.

<sj>Victor</sj> <v>is</v> <cp>being</cp> very mean for some reason.

<sj>I</sj> <v>was</v> <cp>reading</cp> a book at that time.

<sj>I</sj> <v>have</v> <not>not</not> <pp>seen</pp> Jack in a long time.

<sj>I</sj> <v>have</v> <not>never</not> <pp>said</pp> such a terrible thing to my parents.

<v>Have</v> <sj>you</sj> ever <pp>seen</pp> a <ssj>film</ssj> <pp>called</pp> "Last Gamble"?

<sj>I</sj> <v>had</v> <pp>lived</pp> in Osaka for 5 years by that time.

<sj>Jason</sj> <v>is</v> <not>not</not> a rude person in any sense.

On the contrary, <sj>he</sj> <v>is</v> usually nice and friendly.

<sj>I</sj> <v>have</v> <pp>known</pp> him since kindergarten.

My <sj>parents</sj> <v>know</v> him well, too.

<sj>They</sj> <v>like</v> him.

However, <sj>he</sj> <v>has</v> <pp>been</pp> <cp>acting</cp> quite old lately.

<sj>He</sj> <v>ignore</v> me very often.

Actually, almost always.

<sj>What</sj> <v>is</v> <cp>going</cp> on with him?

Maybe <sj>he</sj> <v>is</v> <cp>having</cp> some sort of problem with me.

Maybe <sj>I</sj> <v>did</v> something wrong to him.

Why <not>doesn't</not> <sj>he</sj> <v>tell</v> me then?
<v>Is</v> <sj>Kelly</sj> <cp>coming</cp> back?

<sj>Kevin</sj> <av>may</av> <v>be</v> <cp>working</cp> on it now.

Lucy's <sj>position</sj> <v>has</v> <pp>been</pp> <pp>taken</pp> over by someone else since a long time ago.

The <sj>situation</sj> <v>has</v> already <pp>been</pp> <pp>taken</pp> care of.

<sj>Cindy</sj> <not>cannot</not> <v>have</v> <pp>been</pp> there.

<sj>Lisa</sj> <not>cannot</not> <v>have</v> <pp>said</pp> it.

<sj>Wiliam</sj> <av>must</av> <v>be</v> <cp>studing</cp> hard right now.

<sj>Sam</sj> <av>must</av> <v>have</v> <pp>done</pp> it.

<sj>Louis</sj> <av>must</av> <not>not</not> <v>have</v> <pp>known</pp> better.

<sj>Josh</sj> <av>may</av> <v>be</v> <cp>having</cp> a problem with the math exam.

<sj>Jackson</sj> <av>may</av> <not>not</not> <v>be</v> <cp>teling</cp> the truth.

<sj>Linda</sj> <av>may</av> <v>have</v> <pp>come</pp> yesterday.

The <sj>problem</sj> <av>may</av> <not>not</not> <v>have</v> <pp>been</pp> <pp>solved</pp> yet.

The <sj>suspect</sj> of the most horrendous terrorist attack by a single man in history <av>will</av> probably <v>be</v> <pp>sentenced</pp> guilty.

<sj>Everybody</sj> <v>think</v> so.

However, <sj>he</sj> <not>cannot</not> <v>have</v> <pp>committed</pp> the crime.

The <sj>victims</sj>, well over 100, <v>were</v> <pp>killed</pp> by the attack on January 21 of this year.

<sj>I</sj> <v>was</v> with him all day on the very day.

<sj>Nobody</sj> <av>can</av> <v>be</v> at two different places at the same time, of course.

Why <v>has</v> <not>not</not> <sj>he</sj> <pp>told</pp> the truth yet.
<sj>I</sj> <v>want</v> <ssj>you</ssj> <fp>to help</fp> me.

<sj>I</sj> <v>want</v> <fp>to help</fp> you.

<sj>I</sj> <v>went</v> to the store <fp>to buy</fp> a new computer.

<sj>I</sj> <not>don't</not> <v>have</v> anything <fp>to eat</fp>.

<sj>I</sj> <v>want</v> <ssj>you</ssj> <fp>to calm</fp> down.
