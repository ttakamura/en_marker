My <s>father</s> <v>is</v> a habitual drinker.

The negative <s>image</s> of alcohol <v>is</v> widespread.

However, <s>alcohol</s> <v>has</v> a great variety of benefits.

<s>I</s> <v>drink</v> one glass of wine at dinner every evening.

<s>It</s> <v>helps</v> me tremendously in many ways.

For example, a good <s>wine</s> <v>is</v> a good appetizer.

<s>I</s> always <v>enjoy</v> the meal with it.

Another positive <s>aspect</s> of alcohol <v>is</v> its <cp>tranquilizing</cp> effect.

Thanks to the dinner wine, <s>I</s> <v>have</v> a good sleep every night.

<s>That</s> <av>may</av> <v>be</v> true.

<s>Things</s> <v>look</v> quite unclear in Japanese politics.

However, <s>I</s> <v>disagree</v>.

Political <s>leaders</s> <v>deal</v> with delicate issues day and night.

Therefore, in many cases, <s>they</s> just <not>can't</not> <v>be</v> very clear.

In other words, <s>they</s> <av>must</av> <v>make</v> unclear statements due to the nature of the job.

In my opinion, <s>we</s> <v>are</v> a little too critical about politics and politicians.
