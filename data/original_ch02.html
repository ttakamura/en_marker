<av>Do</av> <sj>you</sj> <v>go</v>?

<sj>You</sj> <v>are</v> <not>not</not> nice.

<v>Go</v>.

<sj>You</sj> <av>may</av> <v>be</v> nice.

<sj>I</sj> <v>am</v> <pp>pleased</pp> with the test result.

<sj>I</sj> <v>am</v> <not>not</not> tall.

Boys, <v>be</v> ambitious.

<v>Is</v> <sj>he</sj> really happy with his job?

<av>Do</av> <sj>you</sj> <v>like</v> your school?

<sj>I</sj> usually <not>don't</not> <v>drink</v> cold water.

<sj>I</sj> <not>don't</not> always <v>eat</v> rice at meals.

<sj>Monica</sj> <not>won't</not> <v>leave</v> for some reason.

<sj>I</sj> <not>can't</not> entirely <v>agree</v>.

<sj>I</sj> <v>am</v> <pp>surprised</pp> at his progress.

<sj>John</sj> <v>is</v> very much <pp>delighted</pp> with my idea.

Japan's political <sj>stance</sj> <v>is</v> often <pp>criticized</pp> as "indecisive".

<sj>That</sj> <av>may</av> <v>be</v> true.

<sj>Things</sj> <v>look</v> quite unclear in Japanese politics.

However, <sj>I</sj> <v>disagree</v>.

Political <sj>leaders</sj> <v>deal</v> with delicate issues day and night.

Therefore, in many cases, <sj>they</sj> just <not>can't</not> <v>be</v> very clear.

In other words, <sj>they</sj> <av>must</av> <v>make</v> unclear statements due to the nature of the job.

In my opinion, <sj>we</sj> <v>are</v> a little too critical about politics and politicians.

What <av>do</av> <sj>you</sj> <v>think</v>?

<av>Do</av> <sj>you</sj> <v>agree</v> with me?
