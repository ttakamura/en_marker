All <ssj>this</ssj> <pp>taken</pp> into consideration, <sj>we</sj> <av>should</av> probably <v>reschedule</v> the whole project.

All <ssj>this</ssj> <pp>taken</pp> into consideration, <sj>we</sj> <v>are</v> <pp>concerned</pp> about the future of the whole project.

Not <cp>knowing</cp> what <fp>to do</fp>, <sj>Jack</sj> <v>tried</v> anyway.

<sj>Leon</sj> <v>cried</v> with his <ssj>hand</ssj> <cp>shaking</cp>.

<cp>Having</cp> much time, <sj>she</sj> <v>was</v> happy.

<pp>Asked</pp> some questions, <sj>she</sj> <v>was</v> <not>not</not> able <fp>to answer</fp>.

<cp>Being</cp> <pp>asked</pp> some question, <sj>she</sj> <v>was</v> <not>not</not> able <fp>to answer</fp>.

<cp>Having</cp> <pp>finished</pp> <cp>running</cp>, <sj>he</sj> <v>felt</v> hungry.

The <ssj>rain</ssj> <cp>beginning</cp> <fp>to fall</fp>, <sj>I</sj> <v>went</v> home.

All <ssj>things</ssj> <pp>considered</pp>, <sj>you</sj> <av>should</av> <not>not</not> <v>give</v> him the green light <fp>to start</fp> that project.

<ssj>It</ssj> <cp>being</cp> late, <sj>we</sj> <av>should</av> <v>go</v> home.

<sj>I</sj> <not>cannot</not> <v>concerntrate</v> with <ssj>you</ssj> <cp>playing</cp> the guiter.

<sj>I</sj> <not>cannot</not> <v>write</v> a letter with your <ssj>dog</ssj> <cp>barking</cp> incessantly.

<sj>She</sj> <v>pondered</v> with her <ssj>eyes</ssj> <pp>closed</pp>.

<sj>He</sj> <v>was</v> <cp>watching</cp> TV with his <ssj>arms</ssj> <cp>folded</cp>.

The <sj>detective</sj> <v>was</v> very professional.

In the interrogation room, <sj>he</sj> <v>remained</v> calm.

<sj>He</sj> <not>didn't</not> <v>say</v> anything.

<sj>He</sj> <v>kept</v> <cp>talking</cp> notes with his <ssj>eyes</ssj> carefully <cp>observing</cp>.

<sj>It</sj> <v>was</v> sort of scary.

<sj>I</sj> really <v>was</v> <pp>arrested</pp> wrongly.

<sj>I</sj> <not>didn't</not> <v>commit</v> a crime.

<sj>I</sj> just <v>happended</v> <fp>to be</fp> at the crime scene.

<sj>That</sj> <v>is</v> all.

At the beginning of the interrogation, <sj>I</sj> <v>knew</v> my innocence for certain.

However, gradually <pp>overwhelmed</pp> by his eyes and calmness, <sj>I</sj> <v>found</v> <ssj>myself</ssj> <cp>losing</cp> confidence.

<sj>I</sj> <v>felt</v> cold <ssj>sweat</ssj> <cp>running</cp> down my back.
